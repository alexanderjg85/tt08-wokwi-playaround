## How it works

Adds 2 7-Bit Numbers. In0 to In6 are Number0 and D0 to D6 are Number 2. Output is given the Sum on Out0 for S0 and Out1 for S1 and so on, Carry out will be at Pin Out7.

## How to test

Change the Switches at In0 to In6 and give a High or Low input at D0 to D6. Output will be the Addition of these 2 Numbers, Carry Out included.
